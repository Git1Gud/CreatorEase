You're citing research papers to me. Do you think that that helped
you be a better investor? MIKE VOLPI:
I fancy myself as an investor that is good at understanding when a technology can actually become a business. When I'm wrong about stuff, I tend to be wrong
because I'm too early. I'm okay being wrong. By the

I had lost my marbles, because nobody invested
in AI in 2017. I think today, it's very
tough to be an AI investor. The industry's matured where it's become a large players game because the capital
required is massive. The intersection between
AI and medicine, it is an area that I've been paying a lot
of attention to. That sector of the world will have hopefully a
ChatGPT-like moment. KEVIN SCOTT:

but I've got like a nice mic."" Be sure that the audio input
device that you're using is the microphone. If you don't have a microphone, you can get a lot better audio by being close to the

407,WHgK7__aix0,True Stories in Tech Podcast - Episode 69 - Danny Brown of AppGallop | Strategic Systems Group,"Strategic Systems Group, Inc. (SSG)",2021-04-12T17:04:18Z,47,1,1,uh the story begins with a young man in tanzania who wandered around to find our website uh our website has a chat feature so he made an inquiry about uh microsoft dynamics ax so he wanted to learn about microsoft dynamics ax with the intent of you know at some point being a consultant the the story evolved a little bit uh in the sense that he has a connection to what i'll call an incubator so i guess in tanzania a a government agency charged with simulating you know new businesses and a consulting firm could be along those lines so the first challenge i think was to learn about about the software so in in the podcast with elena beva she she offered to to make a connection with with this young man in tanzania but it's only part of the story the other part of the story is okay once you know something about the software and are able to do something then what and to form a consultancy requires all kinds of other skills finance and sales and marketing how to manage human resources and so forth so it's a a daunting a daunting challenge one of the things that that occurs to me is that your cohorts are actually being trained to do some of that so i guess my question might be first if you had a little bit of advice to give to a young university student in tanzania who was interested in forming a consultancy what would you tell them first thing join iemcp [Laughter] and i only say that it doesn't have to be iamcp the first thing you need to do is join a group under association and the reason why that's important and i know a lot of people don't like that idea because joining association groups sometimes costs money but when you think about accelerating your learning curve it's all about accelerating your learning curve so that you can go to market so that you can be in a position to run your own company you need to join a group of other individuals who are doing the same thing or have been successful it doesn't have to be imcp that would be my first choice but you can join any group any association that has the same vision and path that you want to go to that's the very first advice i would tell anybody to do from there you will get a lot of people who are what i call seasoned veterans who can assist you with finding grants finding opportunities connecting with bigger organizations such as microsoft who have programs for individuals such as yourself these are things you would never get on your own because the shortest distance between two paths is a straight line and if you can get through that path faster because there's other individuals that's going to pull you there because of their connections to who they know why not do that why not go down that path and so that's exactly what bcpa is doing with with our cohorts that's exactly what imcp is trying to do with our pdp program and the niches we have this individual should do the same thing if you try to figure it out all on your own you might get there it may take 20 30 40 years but it could take two or three years if you do it a different route which is go through an association go through a group where there are like-minded individuals who can mentor you who can guide you and help you really good advice thank you,0.154204839

and he can't find any honey.  ""Oh no! No honey!"" he says.  So he goes into the forest to find some.  He sees a beehive in a tree. He smells the honey. ""Mmmmm! Honey!"" He sticks his paw into the beehive and… ZZZZZZZZZ!  A bee flies out. “Hey, bear! Go away!” says the bee. ""This is not your honey!"" Mr Bear is annoyed.  “I am bigger than you,” he says. “And I am stronger than you too.  I can do what I want! Now... buzz off!”  Mr Bear sticks his paw into the beehive again and… ZZZZZZZZZ!  ZING!   OWIE! The bee stings him right on his nose! “My nose! My nose! Oooh... I'm so angry!"" growls Mr Bear. He finds a big stick. He tries to hit the bee.  He swings and he swings, 
but the bee is too fast!  Mr Bear gets angrier and angrier. ""GARRRRRGHH! I WILL SQUASH YOU! 
COME HERE!"" The bee flies back into the beehive. ""AH HAH! Now you're trapped!"" yells Mr Bear.  He swings his stick at the beehive. Smash! Smash! Smash!  He smashes it to pieces!  Then he hears a strange sound. It gets louder and louder…  ZZZZ! ZZZZ! ZZZ! Zzzz! 
ZZZZZZZZZZ! Zzzz! ZZZZ!  Thousands of bees fly out 
of the smashed beehive.  They fly around Mr Bear's head…  ZZZZZZZZZ… ZING! 
They sting him on his ear.  ZING ZING! 
They sting him on his elbow.  They chase Mr Bear through the forest.  They sting him on his arms, 
his legs, his hands... ... and especially on his nose.    ZING! ZING! ZING!  Mr Bear runs all the way home 
and slams the door shut. BAM!  Then he hears a voice behind him. It’s Mrs. Bear.  “You did it again, didn’t you?” she says. “You lost your temper.” “Yes,” he says as he cries 
and counts his bee stings. “Here’s the bee-sting medicine,” 
says Mrs. Bear.  “Also, we have honey in the cupboard. It’s behind the flour.” Moral: A hot temper always 
gets you into trouble.",0.1155482700892857

The wind blows his strongest gust towards the man, but the man’s jacket stays on.  ""Hmm. It’s a bit fresh today…” he says.  “A winter storm must be coming..."" He zips the jacket higher to cover his nose. “Gah! This is impossible,” says the wind. He stops blowing. “My turn!” says the sun.  First the sun shines enough to stop the snow. The man unzips his hood. Then the sun pulls the clouds apart 
and gently shines down on the man. Suddenly, it is a beautiful spring day. “Wow. The weather sure is strange 
around here!” says the man. He unzips his jacket.  The sun gently wiggles her fingers

0,OX-XEa50fFw,B2 English Listening Practice - Living Abroad,Listening Time,2019-12-02T18:00:04Z,817882,15167,394,hey everybody welcome to this b2 English listening practice video you can use this video to train your listening and comprehension as I speak you ready so today I'm gonna talk to you about living abroad I was an expat for a few years so I can offer a pretty good amount of insight into this topic let's start first with the good things living abroad opens up a whole world of new experiences ideas and cultures that you never would have dreamed of if you hadn't moved abroad the second you step off the plane and realize that you're not just on vacation you're in your new home it can hit you like a truck regardless of how much planning you've done and regardless of how much desire you have to live in that new country the reality of it all will strike fear in you but this fear is actually a good fear it's like an exciting fear you've probably heard the expression to have butterflies in your stomach well the experience of arriving in your new country and knowing that you're gonna set up your life there will definitely give you a serious case of the butterflies it's more like giant moths but like I said I consider that a positive another good thing is that hopefully you'll get to learn a new language ideally you'd already have a decent level in the country's language and so being in that country and surrounded by native speakers would be a great way to improve but as you can probably imagine not everyone gets the same pleasure out of speaking a foreign language as I do or other language learners do so this might be a negative for some people and I personally know people that have been living in a foreign country for four five six years and they can barely put a sentence together so my advice to those moving abroad would be to study the language as much as possible before you go because if you arrive in your new country without knowing any of the language you're not just gonna pick it up it doesn't work like that all the talking you hear around you is just gonna be like static noise in the background it won't make any sense to you and it won't help you learn you need to study and get to the level where you can actually understand the message of what people are saying and then you can go out into the real world and pick it up and then you can have fun speaking that language in your new country all right so the biggest negative about living abroad is obviously being far away from your loved ones this one's a no-brainer it's not easy to live far from your family friends it's one thing to move across the country but moving to a completely different country is a whole nother level of difficulty mainly because it's harder to visit each other I know it's not the same as being with them in person but it does help to video chat or even just call your family what do you think about it it's not that different than talking to them face-to-face except for the fact that you can't touch them see yeah that's the hardest part for sure and the other negative thing is that there are always gonna be certain things about the new country or culture that you don't like in my experience I was able to adapt to my new country pretty well but there were some things that I just couldn't get used to things like the low-quality infrastructure the lack of punctuality and some other minor things you should definitely try to adapt as much as possible on your new country but there will be some things that are just too different or that are contrary to your personality that's the reality of living abroad ok so that's all for today leave a comment and let me know if you ever lived abroad before or if you'd like to live abroad I'll see you next video [Music] [Applause] [Music],0.1544444444444444
