132,2S3PWTED4-Q,Culture Fit: Racial Bias in Tech Podcast,mmhmm,2020-11-16T16:46:49Z,703,23,2,thank you for tuning in i'm darien boyd i work in tech and i build tech products today i'll be your host as we embark on one of the most important journeys of our lifetime but before we begin let's keep it lighthearted because well 2020 hasn't been easy and if that wasn't enough you got to worry about people like this not wearing their mask in public but one thing we know for sure our world is entirely out of balance we can see global social upheaval all around us and much of this can be attributed to a racial divide a divide that's being perpetuated and exacerbated by the tech industry which is the industry that i work for so what are we going to do about it well we felt that this topic deserves a well-informed thoughtful genuine conversation introducing culture fit racial bias in tech it's our way of elevating the conversation and working to build a better future together you see we're not satisfied with the tech industry's progress on diversity equity and inclusion not to mention all of this is going on during a pandemic that's seeing record profits for tech companies while simultaneously widening the wealth inequality gap so maybe you've heard of the term culture fit before in the workplace it refers to hiring people you'd like to hang out with people you'd like to have a drink with this practice is looked down upon because it's shrouded in bias some companies have adopted the term culture ad to reframe the problem but news flash diversity isn't about adding someone to the room it's much more than that and we can see from the numbers that culture fit is still being practiced because the dominant culture in tech excludes a lot of people the personal accounts and stories you'll hear in this series are a first of its kind look at the mistakes being made by the tech industry there are six episodes each about 30 minutes long and we dive into comprehensive topics including how tech giants and the leaders of those companies are failing to hire advance and serve people of marginalized communities and how those very same companies are building products that harm marginalized communities we'll also learn about how access to affordable housing lending opportunities and education play a major role in our inequality finally we'll learn about our own brain function the psychology behind cognitive bias it's the harmful patterns that we reproduce without even realizing it throughout the series you'll hear from the voices of over 30 professionals we amplified the voices of black latinx and indigenous peoples people that are professors researchers community leaders investors founders and other technologists that are dedicated to building a more inclusive and equitable world the intention of this series is for us all to learn how we can not only embrace but celebrate each other's differences and also constantly check our own unconscious bias you see we can work together to build a culture that is truly equitable and welcoming to the diversity of humankind we all individually hold the power to shape the future so let's be intentional about that and work together to hold each other accountable anyway i don't want to give anything else away about the series it's really incredible it's out now you should dive in it's on your favorite platform listen join the conversation and help us elevate thank you,0.187364499,208.0043537,0.02827104,0.043328563,1752.933496,2152.97603,120.1853198,0.9352068305015564

263,JMprUu4ogYo,Let’s Talk Learn-Tech Podcast Debuting Feb 2020,Invince,2020-02-07T10:28:13Z,56,3,0,hello and welcome to the let's talk learn tech podcast it's a Debu podcast and we are super excited to bring this to you all the way from Pune India so you really see there is a correlation is it linear is it multiplied factorial when it comes to a you know a direct impact of the N and D budget on the training success just spending a double budget every year does not guarantee double performance in terms of the skills or the resources or the employees every year so yes the correlation is definitely very strong that if you are able to spend more that means you are able to give more to employees in terms of the revenues and the resources but it has to be very very aptly measured and defined for each employee for each team and even for your key objectives of the company if we are agreeing that L&D budgets are critical for the success for overall decision-making how can businesses get a bang for their buck that is a tricky proposition because it all boils down to this one word which everybody knows but nobody knows the answer to which is ROI so how do you really calculate return on investment when I'm working with you know lot of the lnd champions I try to you know ask them to focus on you know five key areas generally the very first one you know is to know your user group know their needs know their requirements you know what what would you know really make them take up a training and you know achieve the goal that you know you have try to set it for them I would like to play a quick round of rapid-fire I'm gonna give each one of you a sentence and all you have to do is just complete it in the way that you think best fits alright so I'm going to start with a myth the Centers for you is lnd budgets are needed and they need to be allocated very very efficiently for the right activities lnd budget should be I'm are the last one for you lndeed budgets are not me,0.262908346,132.7020408,0.056285519,0.029764824,1236.712495,1577.253101,123.046875,-0.8667556643486023
264,WHgK7__aix0,True Stories in Tech Podcast - Episode 69 - Danny Brown of AppGallop | Strategic Systems Group,"Strategic Systems Group, Inc. (SSG)",2021-04-12T17:04:18Z,47,1,1,uh the story begins with a young man in tanzania who wandered around to find our website uh our website has a chat feature so he made an inquiry about uh microsoft dynamics ax so he wanted to learn about microsoft dynamics ax with the intent of you know at some point being a consultant the the story evolved a little bit uh in the sense that he has a connection to what i'll call an incubator so i guess in tanzania a a government agency charged with simulating you know new businesses and a consulting firm could be along those lines so the first challenge i think was to learn about about the software so in in the podcast with elena beva she she offered to to make a connection with with this young man in tanzania but it's only part of the story the other part of the story is okay once you know something about the software and are able to do something then what and to form a consultancy requires all kinds of other skills finance and sales and marketing how to manage human resources and so forth so it's a a daunting a daunting challenge one of the things that that occurs to me is that your cohorts are actually being trained to do some of that so i guess my question might be first if you had a little bit of advice to give to a young university student in tanzania who was interested in forming a consultancy what would you tell them first thing join iemcp [Laughter] and i only say that it doesn't have to be iamcp the first thing you need to do is join a group under association and the reason why that's important and i know a lot of people don't like that idea because joining association groups sometimes costs money but when you think about accelerating your learning curve it's all about accelerating your learning curve so that you can go to market so that you can be in a position to run your own company you need to join a group of other individuals who are doing the same thing or have been successful it doesn't have to be imcp that would be my first choice but you can join any group any association that has the same vision and path that you want to go to that's the very first advice i would tell anybody to do from there you will get a lot of people who are what i call seasoned veterans who can assist you with finding grants finding opportunities connecting with bigger organizations such as microsoft who have programs for individuals such as yourself these are things you would never get on your own because the shortest distance between two paths is a straight line and if you can get through that path faster because there's other individuals that's going to pull you there because of their connections to who they know why not do that why not go down that path and so that's exactly what bcpa is doing with with our cohorts that's exactly what imcp is trying to do with our pdp program and the niches we have this individual should do the same thing if you try to figure it out all on your own you might get there it may take 20 30 40 years but it could take two or three years if you do it a different route which is go through an association go through a group where there are like-minded individuals who can mentor you who can guide you and help you really good advice thank you,0.154204839,217.9657143,0.051660545,0.044838445,1647.895488,1799.392088,109.9567819,-0.9945008754730225

He sticks his paw into the beehive and… ZZZZZZZZZ!  A bee flies out. “Hey, bear! Go away!” says the bee. ""This is not your honey!"" Mr Bear is annoyed.  “I am bigger than you,” he says. “And I am stronger than you too.  I can do what I want! Now... buzz off!”  Mr Bear sticks his paw into the beehive again and… ZZZZZZZZZ!  ZING!

As Tony said, this is a week after the ""good guys vs. bad guys"" promo. And then a week after, I dunno if this is a new promo or not, which is funnier if they filmed this right after that. If it's new, after Vince cut that promo, it's so much better! Vince says, ""This shit's fake,"" and the week after... Just a video of all these wrestlers talking about their injuries. Undertaker's talking about being dead. Stone Cold is in it, Faarooq is in it. ""Try lacing my boots!"" The whole thing they just talked about all the botches. ""Yeah I almost broke my neck. You know, I dislocated my shoulder on this fucking move."" That was Ahmed Johnson. ""You think this is fake? Do you see how many elbow pads I'm wearing right now?"" Apparently Ahmed, like, no-showed cuz he said he got in a car accident, but there was no proof that he got in a car accident or something, so... ""FUCK YOU!"" I do like these promos though. I thought they were cool back in the day. I know they're propaganda but I thought they were cool. ""You think this shit's fake, huh?"" Damn, Mark??? THAT'S AWESOME! ""You think this is fake?

Everyone's calling wrestling fake and you know- you know what it is."" ""Alright Taker, you're gonna go out there and sacrifice Stephanie McMahon."" ""Yeah I will go... sacrifice your daughter."" ""I killed my whole family."" ""This shit is not fake."" Just a fucking admittance of guilt that he murders his family! And he gets away with it because it's a fake WWF promo! Undertaker doesn't know it's fake, so Paul Bearer is like... Undertaker is so much fucking better if you just look at his whole career and think that he thought it was real! It's a shoot!

So, we want to hear the perspectives from both of you, especially John, on what interested you to begin with in Student Maid. Um, also a little bit of the overview of the entrepreneurial environment and ecosystem on campus and how you hope student made might fit into that. We have a vision to help students create virtuous solutions to vital problems. We believe strongly in collaborative crossdisiplinary creativity with a conscience uh or addressing a real need and a challenge. It's a creative solution in of itself and that you found the need to give students even better experiential learning opportunities and you've addressed it from the creator side uh and and attracted students from a variety of skills and majors and disciplines which is consistent with what we're trying to do at the future center with the foundation of a liberal arts education coupled with what you're training them and developing their skills as creators and makers and problem sol problem solvers. Um I'm pretty excited. It's something pretty special. Honestly, that's why way back when we were inspired for this to be studentled because we truly believe that the students on this campus know it better than anyone else and they're going to be able to make this program appealing to their peers and to people who are connected to it more than we can. No matter where you are on campus, no matter what stage of business or creative venture you have, come be here with us and belong in this space. Make this experience work for where you're at. So I'm curious your perspective on um being a student here. Do you feel like it's a entrepreneurally supportive and creativity supportive place or how and how would you like to see that grow? They're always like hosting like different artistic events and just like with the idea center they're you know supporting people making new things and pursuing that entrepreneurship. So I mean just like in my semester and a half year I mean I've been provided with more opportunities than I ever have. I've been being told I need to start selling the hats I knit forever because I knit like an absolute madman. I am always knitting. Me and my friends will be anywhere and there I am pulling knitting out of my bag. And if I'm going to make something and put so much time into it, I want it to go to someone who's going to appreciate it. And I know the kids at Wesland will absolutely be the audience to appreciate that. It's it's less of like them teaching you. It's all you do it yourself and you learn from your mistakes. I was like, and there's so many professors who want to help you. Our team business is called Grip and Go. We basically sell magnetic attached wallets to the back of your phone. So, we buy like the actual wallets in bulk and then laser engrave them ourselves in the idea center. These students will create marketing plans. Yeah. They'll look and help you review a business plan as a small business owner in the area. They work with some of our students, entrepreneurs, but then they'll often times say, ""Well, here's your marketing plan. You need to create a social media or you need to create a commercial."" So I'm like, but now we've got a whole new set of people and new resources with feature. So now we could deliver what other SBDC's can't.

We're talking about dangerous criminals, assault, rape, so be it. Kidnapping, all that. And they plan on 150,000 by the end of the year. We wish we could do more. Biden led in millions per year, but it's now we got to go find them and and get rid of them. So, um, but in in March of 2025, migrant encounters dropped just to 7,200 from 189,000 in March when um when Biden was office. That's staggering. Those numbers are staggering. So, now we have Doge. Now, Doge um what Trump is delivering on all his campaign promises, he's finding out all of the government waste. Now, Doge uh is eliminating nearly a billion dollars per day in government waste. Now, they're they're halting necessary funding, you know, um for federal hiring, unnecessary funding for federal hiring, you know, cutting off uh DEI scams and stopping Biden error slush funds going into foreign nations. Department of Defense alone, they found $80 million of waste off spending. So, they turned it around and put it right back into our defense bud budget um for our military and to serve our veterans. Now, while Trump is focused on Americans, Biden and his party were too busy worrying about the rest of the world and how they feel. Biden's globalist open border approach and control to of our immigration pol immigration policy to NOS's, foreign governments and cartel coyotes. Trump, he's putting military personnel at the border. Uh he's seizing federal land. You know, he's telling the world, you don't get to walk across our border. You know, we we're a sovereign nation now. You know, a border a nation without a border is not a sovereign nation. Now, we finally have a border. And then this is where it gets disgusting, too. The mainstream media, ABC, MSNBC, CNN, they don't report the news. As you know, I complain about it all the time. They spew Democrat propaganda. I mean, if you look at the the case of this Orteo Garcia, an illegal immigrant deemed a terrorist threat and ordered deported. The media gave that story hours of airtime crying over his removal and questioning Trump's authority and painting Ortega Garcia as the victim. Now, where was the coverage for Lake Riley, Johnson Nuri, and um Rachel Warren? Now, these are American women brutally murdered by legal legals who crossed our wide open border under Biden. combined with those stories got less than 15 minutes on those news stations combined with those stories talking about CNN, MSNBC and ABC 15 minutes total. While this guy um Ortega Garcia is non-stop coverage that's all they talk about is getting him back. They call him the father of the year, the Maryland's father. Get him back home.

I did a little practice because I have a June ACT scheduled. And then afterwards, my sister signed us up for like a business pitch competition. So, we worked on that and we were very successful in brainstorming a good idea. So, we were really happy. Okay, now while I'm making lunch, I'm going to just explain why I'm taking the ACT because I think this is kind of confusing as to why I'm still going with this thing. So, I really want to get a good test score either from an ACT or an SAT. And I feel like I hit a wall with the SAT where I just couldn't keep improving cuz my last test score was the same exact score as my first one. And I know the ACT is like totally different. And I took a diagnostic test and I did okay on it. So, I'm pursuing that now. Oh my god. So, guys, another exciting announcement. I'm starting a podcast with Kiana. Woo! These are some clips from the podcast trailer that we filmed and I edited. Okay, so this podcast is not really relating to this channel or any of my content. It's more of a passion project idea where we'll be interviewing people in the business field. And we just thought this would be a super fun idea to do for college and also just for us to learn more about business, which is the field I'll be going into. Yeah. But if you're interested, I'll tag it down below. We just created it and I really wanted to get it out as soon as possible, the trailer. So, I literally pulled an allnighter to edit it. It was crazy.

It's enterprise wide, but it can also be a differentiator. It can be a differentiator for performance, a way of better understanding, a business model. How do you see those issues really coming together? ESG is a differentiator for companies. I think as the space gets more mature, companies will be better at differentiating themselves, using ESG, I mean, right now, right. You need to be a responsible business. That's table stakes. Your customers want to see you as a partner who's helpful to them. The next step is sort of how do you help your customers meet their goals? Are you creating solutions that help them meet their goals? You know, does Verizon have our own net zero goal? Yes, we do. And how does that feed into their goals 
and how they're meeting their goals? And then I think the taking it up a notch step really is can you help shape customer behavior in what you're doing? And I've seen some companies really innovating in this space, trying to use their branding, their marketing, their advertising 
to change customer behavior, to either be more climate conscious or more conscious of being diverse and inclusive. That's really a win. I love that point that changing behavior is really driving outcomes within the company and across society, and that really reflects ESG as an important topic for business, but also as a way to change the conversation, 
whether it's employees or customers. How have you seen it change the relationship maybe with  customers, employees or even the board? Yeah, so with employees, I've definitely seen us evolve 
in the last couple of years where employees understand the value of being transparent and talking about what we're doing. I think they understand now that our reporting, our ESG reporting is a great way to explain 
all of the terrific governance processes and procedures. Our values, all these things we have in place, 
how do we talk about our impact? And so I have people really proactively coming to me now lobbying to be in the ESG report 
and give us data and make sure that what they're doing is captured. So that's been a conversation that's changed with our board. Our board from day one has been amazing.  They set a tone from the top. They've been really supportive in terms of resources and in terms of helping us prioritize. And I think I've seen that conversation change now to helping us be more strategic. With so much going on in the space. Where should we really focus? What outcomes should we be focused on? And that's always helpful to have the backing of your board like that. Thank you for joining us on the PwC Pulse Podcast.

This particular podcast is about business. I'm going to talk very much about the family business side of it. There's an illusion out there that fast growth equals success. You know, we're all kind of racing to get big growth and grow things really quickly, but there are some real dangers around actually growing fast. There are things like decisions getting slower, accountability gets very murky, and the same issues keep resurfacing all the time. And the analogy that I like to use, it's like an F1 car like going 300 km an hour. It looks amazing, but one wrong move and it's off its track. And so I talk about, you know, the wheels falling off as you grow quickly. So what is it the F1 cars do to make sure that they don't actually make a wrong move, they don't go off track?

1144,hmFQqjMF_f0,How playing sports benefits your body ... and your brain - Leah Lagos and Jaspal Ricky Singh,TED-Ed,2016-06-28T15:02:32Z,2546562,28239,972,"The victory of the underdog over
the favored team. The last minute penalty shot
that wins the tournament. The high-energy training montages. Many people love to glorify victory
on the playing field, cheer for favorite teams, and play sports. But here's a question:
Should we be so obsessed with sports? Is playing sports actually as good for us
as we make it out to be, or just a fun and entertaining pastime? What does science have to say? First of all, it's well accepted that
exercise is good for our bodies and minds, and that's definitely true. Exercising, especially when we're young,
has all sorts of health benefits, like strengthening our bones, clearing out bad cholesterol
from our arteries, and decreasing the risk of stroke,
high blood pressure, and diabetes. Our brains also release a number
of chemicals when we workout, including endorphins. These natural hormones, which control pain and pleasure responses
in the cental nervous system, can lead to feelings of euphoria,
or, what's often called, a runner's high. Increased endorphins and consistent
physical activity in general can sharpen your focus
and improve your mood and memory. So does that mean we get just as much
benefit going to the gym five days a week as we would joining a team and competing? Well, here's where it gets interesting: because it turns out that if you can find
a sport and a team you like, studies show that there are all sorts
of benefits that go beyond the physical
and mental benefits of exercise alone. Some of the most significant
are psychological benefits, both in the short and long term. Some of those come from the communal
experience of being on a team, for instance, learning to trust
and depend on others, to accept help, to give help, and to work together towards
a common goal. In addition, commitment to a team
and doing something fun can also make it easier to establish
a regular habit of exercise. School sport participation 
has also been shown to reduce the risk of suffering
from depression for up to four years. Meanwhile, your self-esteem and confidence
can get a big boost. There are a few reasons for that. One is found in training. Just by working and working at skills, especially with a good coach, you reinforce a growth mindset 
within yourself. That's when you say, ""Even if I can't
do something today, I can improve myself through practice
and achieve it eventually."" That mindset is useful 
in all walks of life. And then there's learning through failure, one of the most transformative,
long-term benefits of playing sports. The experience of coming to terms
with defeat can build the resilience and self-awareness necessary 
to manage academic, social, and physical hurdles. So even if your team isn't winning
all the time, or at all, there's a real benefit to your experience. Now, not everyone will enjoy every sport. Perhaps one team is too competitive, or not competitive enough. It can also take time to find
a sport that plays to your strengths. That's completely okay. But if you spend some time looking, you'll be able to find a sport
that fits your individual needs, and if you do, there are so many benefits. You'll be a part of 
a supportive community, you'll be building your confidence, you'll be exercising your body, and you'll be nurturing your mind, not to mention having fun.",0.188377976,226.4409977324263,0.0525672696530818,0.0617401537666623,2477.9717104080687,2711.9984543820037,114.84375,0.9991156458854675

In 2004, the NFL running back shocked fans when he abruptly retired at 27 after multiple failed drug tests for marijuana. He returned later only to face more suspensions. To Ricky, weed was about mental health. He self-medicated to alleviate his symptoms to manage his anxiety long before the world started listening to athletes about mental health, but back then it was scandalous and to the media it was a cautionary tale. While to fans it was a mystery. His use of marijuana and subsequent suspensions created significant controversies. Critics often misunderstood his actions, attributing them to a lack of discipline rather than recognizing them as a response to his mental health struggles. Williams faced repeated suspensions, lost millions in fines, and was branded undisiplined. But he stuck to his truth. In time, his story flipped. Today, Ricky is one of cannabis's most vocal advocates in sports. He even launched his own wellness brand, Heisman, a nod to his Heisman Trophy win. and his story forced the NFL and fans to reconsider the relationship between cannabis, athletes, mental health, personal freedom, and healing.

I feel like everybody ch like chalked the Timberwolves off. The Lakers were supposed to run through this first round and maybe not run through the playoffs, but a lot of people picked them as the Western Conference final winners. The Lakers were my pick and I'm kind of rattled about it now. But the real story of this game, I think it was two years ago, Anthony Edwards responded to a reporter asking, ""Are you sad you didn't get Kevin Durant?"" And he said, ""Who needs Kevin Durant? We have Jada McDaniels."" Jaden McDaniels was Kevin Durant in this game. We had 25 points. He missed two threes out of eight. That was sort of the Lakers game plan was to let him shoot the ball. Like they were like, ""All right, you know, if Jaden McDaniels beats us on offense, Jaden McDaniel beats us."" Well, he beat you. I don't think Luca, LeBron, A Reeves, I don't think any of them played good enough. It seemed like regular season basketball for them. LeBron kind of looked like he's 40 and it's not often he looks his age, but he looked a little old outside of the one chase down block vintage like blocked by James he had. But other than that, no, you're right. He looked fatigued down the stretch. And this is game one of the playoffs. This is 40-year-old LeBron. We haven't really seen big expectations on a Laker team with LeBron James. I think this is probably the first year, right? Like last year, people weren't picking the Lakers to win at all. I thought the one year they even missed the playoffs. So, this is where that expectation of this LeBron James, a lot of people have him winning it all this year. Are we seeing a downfall? I I don't know. But I I think it's going to be tough for him to keep up the 38 40 minutes a game, the high intensity when you have a superstar Edwards on the other side of the floor who's what's he 25 years old. This isn't the first time LeBron has had expectations to go win the championship with the Lakers. It seems like every year, you know, we see the Lakers make their way into the playoffs and we're saying it's LeBron, man. He can go on a run, he can do it. They expect that every year. It's the Lakers, it's LeBron. Yeah. I think everyone's a little frazzled right now that they just lost game one. Anthony Edwards, 25 years old, as you said, just stellar. LeBron, I know he had AD. Why has he had the supporting cast in a in a caliber player like Luca Donic on the L? Like has he ever had that like superstar guy next to him on the Lakers? I forget if it was last year or two years ago their big deadline acquisition was Ruy Aimura. They were calling him the Jokic stopper in the playoffs and he kind of did a decent job. Yeah, they haven't really had that big time acquisition.
